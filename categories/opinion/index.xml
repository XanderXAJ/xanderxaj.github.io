      <description>Just wanted to quickly chime in on the whole Ferrari one-two fiasco.
I basically agree with what David Coulthard kept saying on the BBC&amp;rsquo;s extended coverage–no matter what fans or press may shout, you can&amp;rsquo;t take the teams out of Formula 1.
They spend millions of pounds on research, design, manufacture, promotion and, of course, the drivers: so is it so bad when sometimes the drivers have to follow &amp;ldquo;team orders&amp;rdquo; to make their team happy?</description>
