      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently moved from the rather dynamic Wordpress to the rather static Jekyll. Can you tell?
I&amp;rsquo;ve come to like the idea of simply serving a bunch of static files instead of dynamically building them when required. Static files are simple, cheap to host and serve, introduce no further security problems beyond the web server and configuration, and easy enough for me, as a developer, to edit.
I&amp;rsquo;ve still got plenty of hurdles to work through &amp;mdash; in particular how to host all my pictures &amp;mdash; but this can all be worked out over time one way or another (including reverting back to Wordpress!</description>
