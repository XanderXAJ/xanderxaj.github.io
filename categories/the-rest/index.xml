      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been helping out Team Maverick One translate Monster Hunter Portable 3rd to English! It&amp;rsquo;s a fan translation with the aim of making the game playable in regions it was never officially released.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been correcting machine-translated English and writing lots of useful scripts to help everyone out. ^^
So if you&amp;rsquo;re wondering what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to lately, that&amp;rsquo;s probably it! Check it out if you have a PSP and are in to Monster Hunter.</description>

      <description>What is this generation&amp;rsquo;s obsession with pinch to zoom? It&amp;rsquo;s so often touted as &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;intuitive&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; that it&amp;rsquo;s beginning to make me go insane! Yes, it might be cool, but have the people who say these things even thought implications of both what they say and the use of such an interface?
Intuitive First, let&amp;rsquo;s get the bit out of the way that always grates me. Pinch to zoom isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;intuitive&amp;rdquo;, contrary to what people say.</description>

      <description>Hello, and welcome to the first post of my blog!
You&amp;rsquo;ve probably found yourself here looking for soundtracks or computer tips or something, in which case go crazy clicking around! This is the first post, so it can&amp;rsquo;t really have that much interesting stuff in it.
Wait. You mean you&amp;rsquo;re reading this post because you&amp;rsquo;re interested in what I have to say?
Okay! If that&amp;rsquo;s the case, then let me talk to you about, well, first posts.</description>
