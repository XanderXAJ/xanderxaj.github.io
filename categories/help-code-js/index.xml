      <description>Some notes to remind future me why Promises are pretty neat.
What do they give me?  They let you regain error handling for asynchronous operations. They let you avoid nested callbacks (and the pyramid indentation that comes with them).  Can I use them? They were initially formalised in the Promises/A+ specification, and have been officially adopted in to JavaScript with ES6.
They&amp;rsquo;ve been supported in all major browsers (except IE) for a while now.</description>
