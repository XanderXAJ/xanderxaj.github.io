      <description>Details upfront: My workaround is to completely disable the AMD GPU via a modded BIOS and let Windows Update install a valid driver for the Intel card. If this concerns you, then don&amp;rsquo;t follow the instructions on this page!
==Disclaimer: I can&amp;rsquo;t be held responsible should things go wrong etc. etc. I can only describe what worked for me.==
I&amp;rsquo;ll be careful. Instructions please! I first made sure that I had uninstalled all of the graphics drivers.</description>

      <description>I recently installed a couple of new plugins to Sublime Text, and then Ctrl+Shift+R, the shortcut for searching through all symbols in a project, stopped working!
You can get Sublime Text to display what&amp;rsquo;s actually going on when you press the shortcut &amp;mdash; that information may give you a hint as to what plugin or configuration has changed your value.
Is the shortcut reaching Sublime? The following commands are run in the Sublime Text Console; you can access on Linux and Windows by pressing Ctrl+`.</description>
