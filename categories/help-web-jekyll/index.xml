      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently talked about [how I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my website to be created with Jekyll][migrate-to-jekyll]. One of the big reasons was to simplify how the site is built and run.
Well, if it&amp;rsquo;s so simple now, then I should be able to modify it on the go within Windows, right? I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been using an openSUSE VM to modify the site, but figured I could do one better and operate (mostly) natively.</description>
