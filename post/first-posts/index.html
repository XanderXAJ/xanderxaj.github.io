  <meta name="description" content="Hello, and welcome to the first post of my blog!
You&rsquo;ve probably found yourself here looking for soundtracks or computer tips or something, in which case go crazy clicking around! This is the first post, so it can&rsquo;t really have that much interesting stuff in it.
Wait. You mean you&rsquo;re reading this post because you&rsquo;re interested in what I have to say?
Okay! If that&rsquo;s the case, then let me talk to you about, well, first posts. You see, I&rsquo;ve been reading first posts and about how to write good first posts a lot lately, and if it&rsquo;s one thing that struck me, it&rsquo;s this: there is no single good way.
To elaborate on that, there is no single good way to introduce a blog; it depends on what effect you&rsquo;re going for.
If you&rsquo;re a techno-centric blog, then you can either jump straight in with your first article, or introduce the blog with what you&rsquo;re going to write about and feature in the coming posts.
If you&rsquo;re opening a quasi-professional blog with personal touches, then your introduction to the blogosphere might be a demonstration of your recent work and your writing abilities (be it prose or code). Or maybe it&rsquo;ll be a friendly introduction to yourself, talking about what interests you at the moment. People like to relate to others, especially if they can imagine meeting and getting along with you in pub. Maybe they already do!
And if you&rsquo;re opening a Livejournal blog for noting down your day-to-day activities and rants… Well, you can do anything.
I&rsquo;ve seen bloggers talk about themselves and what they do in their first posts. Others talk about their current interests. Some religion. Some rants (they seem particularly popular). Others launch into their usual rhythm so well that you click further into their archive, only to realise that was their first post.
In any case, the one thing they all have in common is that, except for being a first post, they don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.
In my case, I&rsquo;ve chosen to talk about first posts themselves. It struck me as the right thing to do, because I find it kinda interesting. After all, everyone is different.
That and, well, it was about time I did something to man up and release this website.
Writing blog posts is one such activity.
Yeah.
PS: Notice how I future-proofed the post? Mhmm.">
